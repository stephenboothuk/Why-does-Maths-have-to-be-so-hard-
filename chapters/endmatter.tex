\part{End Matter} \label{End Matter}

This book was typeset, probably quite poorly, in \LaTeXe by the author as he tried to refresh his knowledge of maths and figured that he may as well write it down and see if anyone else might be interested.

The information in this document have been compiled from a wide variety of sources, as the saying goes ``To steal from one source is plagiarism, to steal from many is research'', in which case this is a very well researched work.  

Updates, additions, changes and corrections may be made as and when deemed necessary.
